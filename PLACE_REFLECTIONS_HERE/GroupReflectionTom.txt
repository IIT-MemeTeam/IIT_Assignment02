For me our group The Meme Team was particularly fluent when given specific direction or requirements and would actively communicate and collaborate to delegate issues to those whom can solve them,
Willingly work around each others skill sets and available times given time zone and non educational commitments in witch i found the group dynamic and rapid to solve any arising conflicts and would be resolved within said meeting or within a sufficient frame of time and with polite and sometimes humorous manor while still being productive,
I found it very enjoy able and was amazed to be able to maintain a playful mood among my group members and still pertain a constructive atmosphere and refocus to the task at hand and have re framed fun with the work,
Generally i find working with others to be quite a struggle to get my point of information to others at a efficient speed and found that in this case I was given acquit time and respect to get though our meetings appropriately,
In retrospect I am quite satisfied by our collaborative efforts and look forward to our groups next assignment and any possible future work with my companions at hand.
