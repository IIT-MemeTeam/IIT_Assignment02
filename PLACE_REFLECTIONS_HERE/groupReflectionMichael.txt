In my reflection of my group of six (6) members I feel we gelled well with each other knew how to have a laugh and when you knuckle down and get things done.
what we as a group we need to improve on meets, while we were all high in attendance, we seemed to get side tacked easily and we did not have a clear idea of what the meetings
were about and it was kind of made up as we went along. but ion saying that this is our first team assessment I feel we have all learned from the experience and we have got to know
each other and become friends and be able to work better in the future group work of this class. what I have learned about groups is the needing to understand everyone and where they 
are coming from and their vision is different from mine. I feel GitHub has helped track our uploads but not what we have done off site say editing files and research away from the site.
