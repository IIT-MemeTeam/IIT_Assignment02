Autonomous vehicles

   

Autonomous vehicles are essentially a driverless car in the sense that it can completely and safely navigate its way around the environment with little to no human input.

The concept of self-driving cars is simple; however, the complex technologies, potential safety issues, and ethical concerns are what is stopping it from becoming a mainstream
technology in the present state. In Australia's current technological climate, our latest road vehicles have automated features, such as self-parking, lane-keep assistance,
and distance assist; however, this only aids with driving. A licensed human still needs to have full control over the car. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, vehicles
in Australia will not need human drivers at all while vehicles increasingly become fully automated. Regulations play a massive part in the complete autonomation of vehicles.
There are 5 levels to vehicle automation in accordance with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations.
Level 1 is the current driver-assist features, as mentioned earlier. Level 2 is Tesla's Autopilot system, where drivers are expected to keep attention on traffic.
Level 3, the driver can do other various things such as use phones and watch movies. Level 4 is the stage where drivers no longer have to be ready to intervene if necessary
quickly, and Level 5 is complete automation.

Sensor technology is an integral system in automation vehicle development. These essentially allow the vehicle to see the environment around them, such as other vehicles,
pedestrians, and other general traffic hazards. The growth in this field of technology will help fast track the implementation of automated services. Another area of
technological advancements required for autonomous vehicles is machine learning. Autonomous vehicles will use both AI and Machine learning to process data collected from
its sensors to decide what it will do from there. Machine Learning will calculate algorithms to identify certain objects and hazards that the sensors detect to determine what
 course of action the vehicle needs to take moving forward. As technology progresses, machine learning will make autonomous vehicles more efficient than a human driver can.

This development's obvious impact allows road users to spend more time doing things they would rather be doing within their vehicle's confines, such as playing with their
phones, watching movies, studying, or even catching up on sleep. If automation technology is perfected, it also eliminates human error in car accidents, making it a very
effective safety measure.  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, driver actions account for over 90% of motor vehicle accidents in the United States
of America. Eliminating human error will result in a significant decline in crashes and fatalities. Not only does this have a significant impact on safety concerns, but
many positive environmental factors come into play with self-driving vehicles. It is predicted that eventually, automated driving efficiency will reduce road traffic,
leading to reduced fuel consumption and, in turn, reduce Carbon dioxide emissions.  According to placesjounal.org, "analysts predict that by 2050 self-driving cars will
save 59,000 lives and 250 million commuting hours annually and support a new "passenger economy" worth USD 7 trillion."

While this does have a significant positive impression on daily commuters, it severely impacts our transport industries, such as Taxis, Uber, Bus companies, and
government-funded rail networks, while also affecting the logistical networks like Truck drivers and Couriers. Without human drivers, businesses can potentially save
hundreds of thousands in staff salaries by automating vehicle services. In the mining and agriculture industries, we have already seen how automated machines can eliminate
the need for human operation and thus have made operating roles in these sectors redundant. Mining Company Roy Hill, which is majority-owned by mining magnate
Gina Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting has agreed to convert 77 of their haul trucks from manned to completely autonomous by 2021, effectively putting 77 truck
drivers out of a job. This is following the lead of other mining giants such as Rio Tinto and BHP. This will leave a huge footprint on the mining industry, no longer
ever needing to hire people in this position ever again whilst beneficially lining the investors' pockets. According to the Australia Taxi Industry Association,
as of December 2014, there were 21,344 total Taxis owned and operated in Australia. Not if, but when self-driving vehicles come into full automation, one would surmise
this will conclusively lead to the end of Taxi needs, thus putting 21,344 Australians in the search for other jobs.

For me, personally, this has a significant positive effect on my life. As a Welder for V/Line, I must drive a truck for daily purposes within my job description - however,
 it is not the sole reason I am employed, as my duties as a welder are my primary role. If truck automation became a mainstay, it would allow so much extra time to cover
 other daily tasks such as paperwork and organizing orders while traveling to and from job sites while still performing my primary welding task.
On the contrary, my father is a locomotive driver with V/Line. Although it is not car automation, a growing concern for Australia's train driving industry is complete
train automation, which would render his employment redundant. Australian federal parliamentary research into automated trains showed increases in efficiency, reliability,
and safety while significantly saving labor costs. There are currently 42 cities worldwide that enjoy the reliable service of automated public railway transport, with
 more than an outstanding 50 percent of them belonging to Asia. While this is extremely positive for traffic reduction, pollution, and cost-effectiveness, the repercussions
 are that it puts hundreds of thousands out of employment worldwide, including locomotive drivers, conductors, engineers, and potentially other railway staff well.
 Although this is not exactly car autonomation, there are many resembling characteristics between self-driving trains and self-driving cars.
