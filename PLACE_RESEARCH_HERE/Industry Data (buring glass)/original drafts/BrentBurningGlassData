-The IT skill required for this role is quite high, with JavaScript listed as the #2 highest in-demand skill follow by JAVA at #3.

Problem Solving (ranked #2), Troubleshooting (ranked #6), and Creativity (ranked #9) are the most crucial general skills in App Development
Other useful skills are Team Work/Collaboration, ranked at #5, and Detail-Orientated, which is ranked #8 most in demand.

relevance in Application Development

Looking over the Burning Glass Data statistics, this has reinforced my desire to explore this role to a greater extent. I feel as though I already possess
the general skills required for this role. I am very interested in my brief studies with IT-related skills. I think a career in this field
would be a good fit for me.
