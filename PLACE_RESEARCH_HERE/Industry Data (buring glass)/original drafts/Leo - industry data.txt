Looking at the data, has your ideal job changed?
My ideal Job requires a lot of different studied IT skills, communication, and collaboration skills. I hadn’t looked at the industry data before this exercise and it has shown me the various skills I didn’t know I would need, some of which I didn’t know like SQL. My ideal job hasn’t changed but I should pick a more specific role under the “gameplay engineer” banner to start with and refine my method for attaining this career through this new pathway.
