											<p>
												Autonomous vehicles are essentially driverless cars; in
												summation, these vehicles can completely and safely
												navigate their way around the environment with little to
												no human input.
											</p>
											<p>
												The concept of self-driving cars is simple; however, the
												complex technologies, potential safety issues, and
												ethical concerns are what is stopping it from becoming a
												mainstream technology in the present state. For
												Australia's current technological climate, our latest
												road vehicles have automated features, such as
												self-parking, lane-keep assistance, and distance assist;
												however, this only aids with driving. A licensed human
												still needs to have full control over the car. It is
												estimated that over the next 20 years
												<a href="#autonomous_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. vehicles in
												Australia will not need human drivers at all while
												vehicles increasingly become fully automated.
											</p>
											<p>
												Regulations play a massive part in the complete
												autonomation of vehicles. There are 5 vehicle automation
												levels following the United Nations Economic Commission
												for Europe (UNECE) World Forum for Harmonization of
												Vehicle Regulations
												<a href="#autonomous_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Level 1 is the
												current driver-assist features, as mentioned earlier.
												Level 2 is Tesla's Autopilot system, where drivers are
												expected to keep attention on traffic. Level 3, the
												driver can do other various things such as use phones
												and watch movies. Level 4 is the stage where drivers no
												longer have to be ready to intervene if necessary, and
												Level 5 is complete automation.
											</p>
											<p>
												Sensor technology is an integral system in autonomous
												vehicle development. These essentially allow the vehicle
												to see the environment around them, such as surrounding
												vehicles, pedestrians, weather, and other general
												traffic hazards. One such sensor technology system that
												has already been developed is called 'Advanced Driver
												Assistance Systems' <a href="#autonomous_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, which are commonly implemented
												in most modern car's safety systems. For the modern car,
												these are not operable directly by the driver but assist
												in crash prevention and parking. By and large, visual
												sensors are the predominant technology implemented by
												ADAS, in addition to lidar (light detection and ranging)
												and radar (radio detection and ranging). The hardware
												and software of ADAS used in modern cars are now being
												targeted towards autonomous vehicles and the future of
												driverless cars, becoming one of the many parts that
												make up an autonomous vehicle. The growth in this field
												of technology will help fast track the implementation of
												automated services.
											</p>
											<p>
												Another area of technological advancements required for
												autonomous vehicles is machine learning. Autonomous
												vehicles will use both AI and Machine learning to
												process data collected from its sensors and then decide
												what it will do with the information from
												there<a href="#autonomous_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.Machine Learning will calculate algorithms to
												identify certain objects and hazards that the sensors
												detect to determine what course of action the vehicle
												needs to take moving forward. Machine learning by its
												very design improves reactions and the decision making
												of autonomous vehicles with every additional set of
												data; this allows the 'car' to make decisions and
												perform actions that are far safer and quicker than the
												everyday human can react. Furthermore, machine learning
												technology<a href="#autonomous_5"><sup></sup>[5]</a> will identify risks, human error, and
												potential hazards on the road from subtle signs most
												humans will not notice. This allows the machine learning
												system to 'learn,' collect data and share this data with
												all other autonomous cars in the system. As technology
												progresses, machine learning will make autonomous
												vehicles more efficient than a human driver can.
											</p>
											<p>
												This development's obvious impact allows road users to
												spend more time doing things they would rather be doing
												within their vehicle's confines, such as playing with
												their phones, watching movies, studying, or even
												catching up on sleep. If automation technology is
												perfected, it also eliminates human error in car
												accidents, making it a very effective safety measure.
												According to the Pennsylvania Department of
												Transportation, driver actions account for over 90% of
												motor vehicle accidents in the United States of America.
												Eliminating human error will result in a significant
												decline in crashes and fatalities. Not only does this
												have a significant impact on safety concerns, but many
												positive environmental factors come into play with
												self-driving vehicles. It is predicted that eventually,
												automated driving efficiency will reduce road traffic,
												leading to reduced fuel consumption and, in turn, reduce
												Carbon dioxide emissions. According to placesjounal.org,
												"analysts predict that by 2050 self-driving cars will
												save 59,000 lives and 250 million commuting hours
												annually and support a new "passenger economy" worth USD
												7 trillion."<a href="#autonomous_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												While this does have a significant positive impression
												on daily commuters, it severely impacts our transport
												industries, such as Taxis, Uber, Bus companies, and
												government-funded rail networks, while also affecting
												the logistical networks like Truck drivers and Couriers.
												Without human drivers, businesses can potentially save
												hundreds of thousands in staff salaries by automating
												vehicle services. In the mining and agriculture
												industries, we have already seen how automated machines
												can eliminate the need for human operation and have made
												operating roles redundant. Mining Company Roy Hill,
												which is majority-owned by mining magnate Gina
												Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting has agreed to
												convert 77 of their haul trucks from manned to
												completely autonomous by 2021<a href="#autonomous_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, effectively putting 77
												truck drivers out of a job. This is following the lead
												of other mining giants such as Rio Tinto and BHP. This
												will leave a huge footprint on the mining industry, no
												longer needing to hire people in this position ever
												again whilst beneficially lining the investors' pockets.
												According to the Australia Taxi Industry Association<a href="#autonomous_8"><sup>[7]</sup></a>,
												as of December 2014, there were 21,344 total Taxis owned
												and operated in Australia. Not if, but when self-driving
												vehicles come into full automation, one would surmise
												this will conclusively lead to an end to the need for
												human-operated Taxi's, thus putting 21,344 Australians
												in the search for other jobs.
											</p>
											<p>
												For me, personally, this has a significant positive
												effect on my life. As a Welder for V/Line, I am required
												to drive a truck for the daily purposes within my job
												description - however, it is not the sole reason I am
												employed as the duties of working as a welder fulfill my
												primary role. If truck automation became a mainstay, it
												would allow so much extra time to cover other daily
												tasks such as paperwork and organizing orders,
												optimizing the time it takes traveling to and from job
												sites while still performing my primary welding task. On
												the contrary, my father is a locomotive driver with
												V/Line. Although it is not car automation, Australia's
												train driving industry's growing concern is complete
												train automation, which would render his employment
												redundant. Australian federal parliamentary research
												into automated trains showed increases in efficiency,
												reliability, and safety while significantly saving
												labour costs. There are currently 42 cities worldwide<a href="#autonomous_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
												that enjoy the reliable service of automated public
												railway transport, with more than an outstanding 50
												percent of them belonging to Asia. While this is
												extremely positive for traffic reduction, pollution, and
												cost-effectiveness, the repercussions are that it puts
												hundreds of thousands out of employment worldwide,
												including locomotive drivers, conductors, engineers, and
												potentially other railway staff well. Although this is
												not exactly car autonomation, there are many resembling
												characteristics between self-driving trains,
												self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, and so on, these
												making up the category of autonomous vehicles.

											<h4>What is Cybersecurity? What makes it so important?</h4>
											<p>
												Cybersecurity is a range of technologies, processes, and
												practices which are created to protect data, devices,
												networks, and applications from anything sinister, ranging
												from unauthorized access to purposefully being damaged
												from a cyberattack. According to DNSstuff, the most common
												types of cyberattacks are: SQL Injections, which utilizes
												malicious SQL code to access hidden information such as
												sensitive company or customer data<a href="#reference_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; Phishing Attacks,
												which is when the attacker poses as a trusted individual
												or company and tricks the victim through email, or text,
												into opening a malicious link, which will most likely lead
												to a malware being installed on the victims system<sup>[2]</sup>; and
												Malware, that refers to malicious software that can damage
												or freeze devices, steal sensitive data, and cause general
												chaos.<sup>[3]</sup>
											</p>
											<p>
												It doesn’t matter who you are or how safe you are, no one
												is invulnerable from a cyberattack. In todays day and age,
												cybersecurity is one of, if not the most, important type
												of defence. In our modern society, access to technology is
												necessary. Almost everybody nowadays uses some kind of
												computer and phone. On most of these devices, people keep
												all their personal information, like stored passwords,
												bank accounts, social media accounts, and private photos.
												Anyone can learn how to access this information, with
												enough time and patience, any one can learn how to steal
												information. Scamming someone and stealing their
												information, is as easy as sending an email, or borrowing
												their phone to “make a call”.
											</p>
											<p>
												There are various ways to be protected, the main, of
												course is downloading an antivirus/antimalware program,
												which can help to protect your devices from malicious
												programs and individuals. This may seem like enough
												protection for some people, but others use VPNs (Virtual
												Private Network) to route their internet connection though
												a providers private server, creating a “tunnel” which
												encrypts your data.
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the many years that we have had computers, our safety
												has had to evolve with it. Back in the old days, before
												internet banking, social media, online gaming, etc. people
												did not have much to worry about, although there were
												still malicious programs and people out on World Wide Web,
												there was less of a worry of people getting their
												information stolen from the internet. The first known
												computer virus was a worm named Creeper which would
												display a message saying “I’m the creeper: catch me If you
												can!” created by Bob Thomas in 1971. It was put onto
												APRANET (a network which was the foundation of the
												internet we know today<sup>[6]</sup>) to spread to different
												computers and self-duplicate, as Creeper duplicated
												itself, it would erase older versions of itself<sup>[5]</sup>. In
												retaliation to this, Thomas’s friend wrote another program
												to delete any instance of Creeper appropriately named:
												Reaper. Thus making Reaper the first anti-virus software.
											</p>
											<p>
												Later, in 1989, the “Morris Worm” started to spread, which
												was the first DoS (denial of service) attack to spread
												around the internet. Which affected around 6,000
												computers. According to the crator of the Morris Worm;
												Robert Morris. It was designed to determine just how big
												the internet was, although what the would do was infect
												the same computer over and over thus slowing it down to
												the point of crashing. To rid the world of the Morris
												Worm, regional networks had to be disconnected for several
												days, shutting down the entire internet. From this teams
												were created to tackle these kinds of issues, these teams
												were called Computer Emergency Response Teams, or CERTs
												for short.<sup>[4]</sup>
											</p>
											<p>
												Then came the 90s, all new exciting technology! Easily
												accessible by the public, Tamagotchi’s for the kids!
												Phones which could be inside of cars! Super HD realistic
												amazing graphics in video games! And the most exciting,
												VIRUSES! Any one could upload anything, so why not upload
												viruses? They started primarily as pranks pulled by
												internet trolls, but later expanded into more complex
												infections, like trojans, spyware and malware.
												Unfortunately, CERTs couldn’t really do a lot, yes they
												would fight the viruses, but they just a response team,
												like the SES (State Emergency Service) in Queensland,
												Australia. They could react and deal with the emergency
												when it came to be, but could prevent the outbreak to
												occur. Thus allowing anti-virus software to enter, by
												smashing the wall down, fighting the viruses, and saving
												peoples data.<sup>[4]</sup>
											</p>
											<p>
												Coming to now, we have cyber-attacks have drastically
												evolved. Cybercriminals are coming up with more malicious,
												creative, and challenging ways to obtain peoples data and
												ruin people’s lives. This brings us onto the question,
												what is the new state of the art  technology regarding
												cybersecurity? Anti-malware companies such as Symantec are
												using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to “…
												analyze all of the data running into or out of an
												organization to determine where the vulnerabilities of
												those systems lie.” <sup>[7]</sup> AI and Machine Learning can
												analyse data collected from millions of different
												incidents, and utilize this knowledge to identify
												potential threats. Network-monitoring tools can also be
												used (which utilize AI) to gather the daily behaviour of
												users, and analyse the information collected to smoke out
												anything malicious, whether it be a program downloaded on
												the computer, or a link someone clicked on in an email.
												Thus, making it harder for hostile threats to harm
												devices.<sup>[7]</sup>
											</p>
											<p>
												However, this does not mean people cannot steal your
												information or data, it just makes it harder for harmful
												programs to access your data, unfortunately people can
												still steal your details from social media sites such as
												Facebook, or Instagram, and they can take information from
												your mailbox or mail which has been thrown in the rubbish.
												They can download photos, take your name, and pretty much
												steal your identity. With the correct safety measures this
												can be prevented, by privatising your profiles, limiting
												the amount of information uploaded onto these sites,
												putting a lock on your mailbox, and disposing of mail
												thoroughly.
											</p>
											<p>
												According to Microsofts CYBERSPACE 2025: Today’s
												Decisions, Tomorrow’s Terrain there are three future
												scenarios as to what is going to happen. The first being
												Plateau which predicts that some countries are able to
												advance in economically and socioeconomically with the use
												of technology, while others are left behind, causing a
												very uneven terrain for cybersecurity. The second Peak,
												which is when governments collaborate to promote strong
												open trades. In this scenario, businesses, governments and
												other organizations encourage the widespread use of
												technology, resulting in an accelerated growth of improved
												cybersecurity. The third scenario is Canyon, which has a
												limited use of ICT, causing none to slow growth of
												cybersecurity, due to the isolation, and obstructionist
												government policies, restricting trade amongst others, and
												lessening economic and socioeconomic relationships with
												other countries. <sup>[8]</sup>
											</p>
											<p>
												I honestly feel that the most likely scenario out of these
												three is Plateau. Primarily because, right now some
												countries have been struggling to advance technologically,
												and I feel that this will continue for at least another
												decade, though I do think that the world will be trying to
												push towards the Peak scenario, I do not think that the
												Peak outcome will occur for a while.
											</p>
											<p>
												This would create more jobs in the cybersecurity sector,
												and in IT in general. With the big demand for
												cybersecurity professionals at the moment, it means that
												if by 2025, the Plateau scenario or the Peak scenario
												occurs, there will be an even bigger demand for
												cybersecurity professionals.
											</p>
											<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
											<p>
												Everyday I use my computer, smart phone, smart watch, car
												head-unit, and online banking. All of my information like
												my name, phone number, address, etc. is accessible on all
												of these except my cars head-unit, with the correct safety
												measures, and anti-malware programs, I have been keeping
												myself self and my family safe.

										<div class="panel">
											<br>
											<p>
												IT Technology I’ll be focusing on is Cloud
												Services/Computing. Cloud computing is a delivery various
												internet service. An On-demand technology where users can
												utilize IT resources over the internet and work on these
												services as a pay per use mechanics rather then a
												subscription service that is monthly or the user can pay
												monthly or annual. Cloud computing also enables the user
												to store data and resources in a server on another
												premises and allows thee user to access the information
												from any point of access around the globe all they need is
												an internet connection and the correct user credentials.
												Services that cloud technology is growing by the day,
												there are usually three types of models used in cloud
												services.
											</p>
											<p>
												The first form is SaaS (Software as a Service). SaaS uses
												the web to convey applications, which are overseen by an
												outsider seller, to its clients. A majority of SaaS
												applications run directly through your internet browser,
												which implies they do not need any downloads or
												establishments on the customer side. Because of its web
												conveyance model, SaaS wipes out the need to have IT staff
												download and install applications on every individual PC.
												With SaaS, merchants deal with all expected specialized
												issues, for example, data, middleware, servers, and
												storage, resulting in streamlined maintenance and support
												for the business. SaaS gives various preferences to
												workers and organizations by extraordinarily diminishing
												the time and cash spent on repetitive assignments, for
												example, installing, overseeing, and updating software.
												This opens up a lot of time for specialized staff to spend
												on all the more pressing issues and issues inside the
												organization.
											</p>
											<p>
												The second form of cloud service is Platform as a Service
												(PaaS). PaaS delivers certain software while being
												utilized for applications. PaaS conveys a structure for
												designers that they can expand upon and use to make
												modified applications. All servers, storage, and
												networking can be overseen by the enterprise or an
												outsider supplier while the designers can keep up the
												board of the applications. The delivery model of PaaS is
												like SaaS, aside from as opposed to conveying the product
												over the web, PaaS gives a stage to programming creation.
												This stage is conveyed by means of the web, giving
												engineers the opportunity to focus on building the product
												without agonizing over working frameworks, programming
												updates, storage, or infrastructure. This cloud service
												can enormously lessen expenses and it can improve a few
												difficulties that surface in the event that you are
												quickly creating or sending an application.
											</p>
											<p>
												The third form of cloud service is Infrastructure as a
												Service (IaaS), is made of exceptionally adaptable and
												mechanized figure assets. IaaS is completely
												self-administration for getting to and monitoring the
												computer, systems administration, networking, storage, and
												other services. IaaS permits organizations to buy assets
												on-request and varying as opposed to purchasing equipment
												outright. IaaS delivers cloud computing infrastructure,
												including servers, operating systems, networks, and
												storage, through virtualization technology. These cloud
												servers are normally given to the organization through a
												dashboard or an API, giving IaaS customers unlimited
												oversight over the whole foundation. IaaS gives similar
												technologies and storage as a traditional data centre
												without having to truly keep up or deal with every last
												bit of it. IaaS customers can in any case get to their
												servers and storage directly, yet it is completely
												redistributed through a "virtual data centre" in the
												cloud.
											</p>
												Rather than SaaS or PaaS, IaaS customers are liable for
												overseeing angles, for example, applications, runtime,
												OSes, middleware, and data. Nonetheless, suppliers of the
												IaaS deal with the servers, hard drives, systems
												administration, virtualization, and storage.
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the next few years there is talk about trying to get
												a Graphics as a Service (GaaS) in relation to the demand
												for high end Graphic Processing Units (GPU) as high end
												computers become more a demand from gamers and video
												editors alike try and get the most out of the GPU and CPU
												this is a service that will be a faction of the cost and
												help all user achieve the demands of a high end system
												without the over heads.
											</p>
											<p>
												Technological developments that make cloud computing
												possible are Broadband networks and internet architecture
												as the cloud network needs to be connected to the internet
												to access from anywhere around the globe. Data centre
												technology in relation to have a large number of servers
												at one location (e.g. Google date centre) all connected to
												the internet to have users connect.
											</p>
											<p>
												Also, a need for Virtualization technology. Virtualization
												is a process of converting a physical IT resource into a
												virtual IT. Web technology, Cloud computing relies on
												internet. Web technology is generally used as both the
												implementation medium and the management interface for
												cloud services.
											</p>
											<p>
												Multitenant technology Enable multiple users (tenants) to
												access the same application simultaneously. Multitenant
												applications ensure that tenants do not have access to
												data and configuration information that is not their own.
											</p>
											<p>
												The likely impact of the globe changing to a cloud service
												system, is that companies can reach around the globe to do
												business with, IT Help desk can remote access a computer
												and help fix the issues without having to have someone go
												to site and help their clients. What is likely to change
												relation to cloud services is getting faster access to
												networks larger files transferred to another virtual
												computers and to your physical computer on site. I believe
												the most affected people that cloud services will do is
												the need for on site IT staff to fix ,repair and upgrade
												on site machines, and a need to have any IT staff on site
												reducing over heads for companies and making redundant the
												need for a local IT employee, also reducing the need to
												have a high end storage system set up off site and
												reducing the size of the building needed for each company
												having their servers cloud computing at a off-site data
												centre. Having the data servers off site and run by
												another company lowers the cost of maintenance and the
												need to upgrade the computers on site.
											</p>
											<p>
												I feel in my daily life cloud computing is used most of
												the day, I’m doing online schooling with the global
												pandemic, I play video games with my children over the
												servers with game sharing on the consoles I don’t have a
												need to buy a games twice. When I am out and about and
												think about something I need to type up at a later point
												when I have access to my computer I can write it in to my
												phone and then my phone syncs to the cloud services I have
												and then when I turn my computer on it loads up and syncs
												to the cloud services and brings my saved document from
												the cloud to my pc. A good example of one of these
												services is OneDrive. I also help my mother run a website
												for the aged care lifestyle coordinators around the world
												and we both have input on the site from WordPress to
												Dropbox. With out these 2 cloud services I would not be
												able to help my mother as she is an hour away from my
												location. My partner uses cloud services to stay in touch
												with the work happening in her office as she is working
												remotely. If we did not have these services at hand or
												readily available everything I have mentioned above from
												schooling online to the games we play to the documents we
												share between friends family and work with out the
												advances we have had in cloud computing and cloud
												technologies none of this would be available.

										<button class="accordion actions fit">Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</button>
										<div class="panel">
											<br>
											<p>
												A Blockchain is the peer-to-peer technology that permits users with a common interest to co-create transparent, unchangeable, ledgers of transactions, without the need to trust the other parties in the peer-to-peer network or the need to rely on a central authority. A transaction is finalised into a block not unlike a page in a paper ledger, all blocks are chained from the original block to the most recent block. A single party or parties are unable to make an unauthorised change to the ledger as there is no one central clearing authority who can allow or deny the change, it’s essentially all the users of the peer-to-peer network who authorise adding a block by checking all the previous blocks in the chain, thus changing a block that is already part of the chain is not possible.
											</p>
											<p>
												Though the name cryptocurrency has the word “currency”, it is better to refer to cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, this is due to the debate that a currency shouldn’t have intrinsic value, though being a medium of exchange is essentially the same thing. These mediums of exchange use the blockchain technology to validate and legitimise transactions, a person can own cryptocurrency and use it to purchase goods and services privately and securely. Because cryptocurrency is not regulated, it first found its use by criminals on the internet black market, though now many users have come to cryptocurrency for its practicality, speed, and security.
											</p>
											<p>
												Spotify is a good example of how blockchain technology is used today, Spotify is using a decentralised database to allow artist to be consistent with license agreements and tracks. They are attempting to solve the issues of artist and labels in the industry which are not being fairly acknowledged with blockchains transparency and unchangeable ledgers.
											</p>
											</p>
												A good example of what could be done soon (and is in development) is with banking, currently in order to transfer currency from an Australian bank to another country it requires the money to go through multiple banks with multiple layers of intermediation, taking an undetermined amount of time without a clear ledger of where the money travelled. Blockchain technology can securely move digital assets without the need of these banks or third parties, this also allows financial services access for people who didn’t have access before and removes many of the transaction and processing fees involved in moving Fiat currency.
											</p>
												<h4>The technology of blockchain that makes these services work</h4>
											<p>
												Blockchain is made up or the past and current transaction ledgers as ‘blocks’, to add a new block first a miner would attempt to add transactions as the newest block to the chain. For a miner to be able to achieve this, they must run a full node with the entire transaction data of the blockchain, this data will be compared to data from the other nodes in the peer-to-peer network to verify its legitimacy. Furthermore, the miner must complete an energy intensive mathematical equation using the RAM, CPU, and graphics card of their device competing with other miners for the right to add the latest transaction to the blockchain. As they are using their energy and hardware (technology with computational power, i.e. computers, phones, servers), Miners are sometimes incentivised with rewards of cryptocurrency to perform these tasks which keeps the blockchain maintained.
											</p>
											<p>
												As these transactions are broadcast to the peer-to-peer network of nodes, the node’s job is to store, spread, and keep the transaction history of the blockchain data as this forms the infrastructure of the blockchain and is considered the blockchain itself. These nodes use known algorithms to check and verify the transactions and user’s status. Once validated by the nodes, the transaction combines with the previous blocks in the chain, creating a new block that consist of the previous and current transactions and their data. The new block is added to the chain where it can no longer be altered or moved. A node simply acts as a gatekeeper with a directory of the blockchain transaction history as well as update other nodes that are coming online or are outdated.
											</p>
											<p>
												This Technology can be used to create secure communication in hostile environments, there is no need to rely on trust when using a decentralised system like blockchain as it enables every user to have equal privileges. With blockchain technology there is no good or bad, right or wrong, there is only valid or invalid. This is changing some jobs already, for instance; A job involved with supply chain’s no longer needs an intermediary to process and account all the transactions between a business deal as blockchain is a reliable foolproof record that the ecosystems of business partners can easily adopt. Thus, for some jobs, the impact of this technology has removed the time, effort and management involved that would require checking ledgers and accounts, as well as making some jobs redundant.
											</p>
											<p>
												It is hard to say who is likely to be most affected by blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, as these are not bound by geography it is very possible that the citizens of a country such as Venezuela (Venezuelan’s are currently in an economic crisis) would look to cryptocurrency to bypass their hyperinflated fiat currency.
												There are also talks about availability of people’s information, one forbes article wrote about the permanent storage of customer health data and their identity which will allow health care systems to accurately find your medical history. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Blockchain technology allows business to process data faster and more efficiently, sometimes by cutting out the middle man entirely and other times by changing old jobs or adding new jobs. Such jobs could be the creating the standardised template for a business to enter their data, data entry, running a node or mining and its maintenance.
											</p>
											<p>
												To the average Australian, blockchain and cryptocurrency will not be a technology they actively know they are using until cryptocurrency and its uses are adopted by businesses and systems that already have their place in society i.e. banks and supermarkets, or until blockchain is used to store citizens data. It may take a while for this technology to be used by a health care system or a form of payment, personally I would not want my medical history stored in a capacity that doesn’t allow it to be erased, this could create a road block for potential jobs and government forms that I would rather authorities to be ignorant about. It is possible that if personal data is stored and allowed to be viewed by employers or governments, then, for example, a lot of power is given to the previous employer who enters that data.
											</p>
											<p>
												As a new technology Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is not regulated by government, but laws are able to be created and changed which brings up concern for my family and myself about our privacy. The ability to take advantage of blockchain technology doesn’t provide much difference in my daily life until it is adopted by the systems that I use, and if it were then I would use it to transfer money between my families and my own foreign and Australian bank accounts while I’m traveling abroad.
											</p>
											<p>
												As an example of the use for us students looking for a career in the IT industry, the ability to create a side project outside of work hours and storing the ongoing documentation in an unchangeable ledger very well may affect some of us. To have unchangeable dated and timed documentation may be very useful to some students who wish to protect their intellectual property against a company that claims you used their time or resources to work on the project.
											</p>
											<p>
												As a whole, I like the idea of cryptocurrency and how it can improve our lives, and the technology of blockchain for removing the trust involved in business, yet I am weary about the possibilities of a system that stores personal information.
