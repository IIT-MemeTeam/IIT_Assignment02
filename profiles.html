											<h3 class="major">Brent Kimm</h3>
											<p>My name is Brent Kimm, S3873880, S3873880@student.rmit.edu.au; I am a 30-year-old male from Melbourne, Australia.
											I completed VCE in 2008 and have since worked in various roles within the Railway and Civil industries.
											When I was 5 years old, I received a NES for Christmas with the Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. From there on, I played
											a wide array of games before eventually deciding to build my own computer many years later. This is where my
											interest in the field of Information Technology began...</p>

											<p>I am extremely passionate about Football and Basketball, being a major Saints and Celtics fan respectively
											outside of gaming and computers. I also love fishing, camping, and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city to
											explore our beautiful country.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Leonard McDonald</h3>
											<p>Leonard McDonald, student number s3879586, s3879586@student.rmit.edu.au, 28 Male Australian. When I was in primary school, I had no idea why my brothers friend could play NES roms on his computer while they wouldn’t work on our macintosh, from this starting point my interest in IT and all its workings would manifest. Classmates in my country side high-school were impressed by the small scripts i could write, and as I moved forward my interest developed my skills in problem solving, video editing, and just enough of everything else to play around with at beginner level. I’d like to work on game mechanics, design and video editing in my spare time, and I believe that the skills I learn from working with our group ‘Meme Team’ will benefit me both in the course and my hobbies</p>

											<h3 class="major">Lochlann Keenan Kelli</h3>
											<p>My name is Lochlann Keenan-Kelli, but you can just call me Lo. My RMIT student number is
											S23872026. I live in Queensland with my fiancee. I spend alot of my free time gaming,
											and chilling out. I used to have a dream of setting up an American styled 50's diner.
											But this dream got crushed when I realised I do not like working in Hospitality.
											So I decided to change my dream to something involving my hobbies;
											IT. I have been mucking around with computers ever since I was a very young child,
											I was always getting new technology, breaking it, troubleshooting what I did, and then fixing it all
											up again.</p>
