									<p>
										We are a team of 6 guys who simply just love memes, hence
										the "Meme-Team"! We enjoy talking in "meme language" in
										various different I.T chats and that's how we found each
										other. While we understand we occasionally tend to irritate
										others with the way we talk, this passion for memeing brings
										us enjoyment and creates team chemistry for us.
									</p>
									<p>Meme-team requirements? Always meme.</p>

												I am a 30-year-old male from Melbourne, Australia. I
												completed VCE in 2008 and have since worked in various
												roles within the Railway and Civil industries. When I
												was 5 years old, I received a NES for Christmas with the
												Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. From there on, I played a
												wide array of games before eventually deciding to build
												my own computer many years later. This is where my
												interest in the field of Information Technology began...
											</p>

											<p>
												I am extremely passionate about Football and Basketball,
												being a major Saints and Celtics fan respectively
												outside of gaming and computers. I also love fishing,
												camping, and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city
												to explore our beautiful country.

												 I am a 28 Male Australian. When I was in primary
												 school, I had no idea why my brothers friend could play
												 NES roms on his computer while they wouldn’t work on
												 our macintosh, from this starting point my interest in
												 IT and all its workings would manifest. Classmates in
												 my country side high-school were impressed by the small
												 scripts i could write, and as I moved forward my
												 interest developed my skills in problem solving, video
												 editing, and just enough of everything else to play
												 around with at beginner level. I’d like to work on game
												 mechanics, design and video editing in my spare time,
												 and I believe that the skills I learn from working with
												 our group ‘Meme Team’ will benefit me both in the
												 course and my hobbies

												My nickname is Lo and I live in Queensland with my
												fiancee. I spend alot of my free time gaming, and
												chilling out. I used to have a dream of setting up an
												American styled 50's diner. But this dream got crushed
												when I realised I do not like working in Hospitality. So
												I decided to change my dream to something involving my
												hobbies; IT. I have been mucking around with computers
												ever since I was a very young child, I was always
												getting new technology, breaking it, troubleshooting
												what I did, and then fixing it all up again.

												Hello there. I'll start with a little about myself I have
												a background in warehousing and I’m moving to IT for a
												career change, I am half German and half Australian, I
												only speak English. My education to date is finishing
												year 12 in 2005 I studied IT and Multimedia throughout
												my college life but finishing year 12 I pursued a career
												in warehousing and driving forklifts. Hobbies I enjoy
												are four-wheel driving and off-roading with camping
												overnight in the bush near a river. I also play the
												guitar and did so in a band for roughly 4 years touring
												the East Coast of Australia. Other pass times I enjoy
												playing video games with my 3 children.
